Hello,
A few messages about the website is written below.
The CSS is slightly different than what was given to my teammates because
I changed it constantly after watching videos and reading w3schools, etc.
I have notified my team and since it was too late to make changes, we will
make it all uniform for the next assignment since I'm the outlier.

The Database used to work with the website is named product_db
and the table used was named products.

Otherwise, everything else is pretty self-explanatory because the basic 
CRUD operations was put on the home page.
